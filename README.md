# react-list-container

This project is the solution of Middle/Senior Front-End Engineer Test Task.\
It was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Task:

Create a component that effectively renders a large list of items (e.g. 10,000 elements) with the
assumption that all items in the list are the same size.\
Support items of different sizes and render additional elements above and below the visible
elements, so theyâ€™ll already be visible when they scroll into view.\
Provide a working repository with this component built on top of create-react-app with typescript
template.\
Please do not use any 3rd party components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Tests have not been created yet.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
